Then isn't that natural hierarchy, wouldn't the older brother become the head anyway? All this made me feel like he must've been talking about his younger brother. So IDK if this is a mistake.} {idt they care about birth order, only strength, they're progressive like that :)}
Dialogue: 0,0:06:27.33,0:06:30.20,Default,Maki,0,0,0,,Because you're an asshole who'd \Nmurder his own children?

Dialogue: 0,0:07:11.24,0:07:13.25,Default,Ogi,0,0,0,,so you closed in.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:13.25,0:07:15.50,Default,Ogi,0,0,0,,This is why you're hopeless.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:16.04,0:07:18.71,Default,Ogi,0,0,0,,I'm not a swordsman. I'm a sorcerer.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:18.71,0:07:23.17,Default,Ogi,0,0,0,,Do not presume to judge me \Nby the standards of a failure. It's absurd. {CR: Trying to gauge me by the standards of such a failure is absolutely ridiculous!}

Dialogue: 0,0:07:25.01,0:07:29.68,Default,Ogi,0,0,0,,I wasn't chosen as the head of the clan \Nbecause of you two. {Getting chosen as the "former head" is kind of a hilarious position. "I wasn't chosen as the head of the clan" is enough past tense, no? Or "I wasn't chosen as the head of the clan at that time because of you two"} {right. still there's ambiguity if we drop "former" bc then it could mean he was competing with naoya. well, i'll just let context handle it}
Dialogue: 0,0:07:29.68,0:07:32.60,Default,Ogi,0,0,0,,My older brother's technique\Nhad a shallow history.
