Dialogue: 0,0:02:02.97,0:02:04.38,Default,Tsukumo,0,0,0,,Kenjaku?
Dialogue: 0,0:02:05.44,0:02:07.68,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,What was once Kamo Noritoshi.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:07.68,0:02:11.39,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,The sorcerer currently inhabiting \NSuguru Geto's body.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:11.39,0:02:14.78,Default,Tsukumo,0,0,0,,A net of compassion and \Na rope of salvation, huh?
Dialogue: 0,0:02:14.78,0:02:16.88,Default,Tsukumo,0,0,0,,He didn't even try for \Nsarcasm with that name.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:17.88,0:02:20.21,Default,Yuji,0,0,0,,Why are you like that, {*}Master Tengen{*Tengen-sama}?
Dialogue: 0,0:02:20.21,0:02:23.17,Default,Fushiguro,0,0,0,,{\i1}Ballsy of him to insert himself \Ninto the conversation there...
Dialogue: 0,0:02:23.87,0:02:26.88,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,I'm immortal, but not ageless.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:26.88,0:02:29.66,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,You'd look like this, too, \Nif you were 500 years old.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:29.66,0:02:30.79,Default,Yuji,0,0,0,,Seriously?
Dialogue: 0,0:02:31.80,0:02:33.96,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,Since I failed to assimilate
Dialogue: 0,0:02:33.96,0:02:38.40,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,with the Star Plasma Vessel twelve \Nyears ago, my aging has accelerated,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:38.40,0:02:41.26,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,and my identity as an \Nindividual has vanished,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:41.26,0:02:44.43,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,so the world itself is who I am now.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:45.24,0:02:49.25,Default,Tsukumo,0,0,0,,So there wasn't actually another \NStar Plasma Vessel back then?
Dialogue: 0,0:02:49.91,0:02:52.67,Default,Tsukumo,0,0,0,,That explains why there isn't a new voice.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:53.15,0:02:54.60,Default,Fushiguro,0,0,0,,Excuse me.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:54.60,0:03:00.08,Default,Okkotsu,0,0,0,,We came here to learn Kenjaku's goal \Nand how to open the Prison Realm.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:00.08,0:03:02.20,Default,Okkotsu,0,0,0,,Could you tell us what you know?
Dialogue: 0,0:03:04.20,0:03:05.70,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,Of course.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:05.70,0:03:10.23,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,Or so I'd like to say, but I \Nmust impose one condition.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:10.23,0:03:11.69,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,Okkotsu Yuta.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:11.69,0:03:12.86,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,Tsukumo Yuki.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:12.86,0:03:14.33,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,Cursed Womb Death Painting.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:14.90,0:03:18.22,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,I'll need two of you three to remain here
Dialogue: 0,0:03:18.62,0:03:20.67,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,and guard me.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:21.15,0:03:23.72,Default,Okkotsu,0,0,0,,Guard you? But you're immortal, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:03:24.06,0:03:26.44,Default,Maki,0,0,0,,Are you afraid of being sealed or something?
Dialogue: 0,0:03:26.44,0:03:27.98,Default,Tsukumo,0,0,0,,That isn't fair.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:28.37,0:03:31.27,Default,Tsukumo,0,0,0,,You won't tell us why or \Nhow long we're guarding you?
Dialogue: 0,0:03:38.70,0:03:40.06,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,In that case,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:43.28,0:03:45.94,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,let me speak of Kenjaku.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:46.73,0:03:48.66,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,That man's objective
Dialogue: 0,0:03:48.66,0:03:53.11,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,is to force the evolution of \Nmankind throughout all of Japan.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:54.42,0:03:55.98,Default,Fushiguro,0,0,0,,I heard about that.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:56.53,0:03:59.30,Default,Fushiguro,0,0,0,,But how does he actually intend to do it?
Dialogue: 0,0:03:59.30,0:04:01.29,Default,Fushiguro,0,0,0,,Why didn't Kenjaku use your barriers
Dialogue: 0,0:04:01.29,0:04:03.84,Default,Fushiguro,0,0,0,,to turn everyone in Japan \Ninto jujutsu sorcerers
Dialogue: 0,0:04:03.84,0:04:08.08,Default,Fushiguro,0,0,0,,with Idle Transfiguration back then?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:10.00,0:04:14.14,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,Because he simply lacked the \Ncursed energy to do that.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:14.66,0:04:18.62,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,The cursed energy refined through \NMaelstrom can't return to the sorcerer.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:19.06,0:04:23.72,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,Also, evolving people one person at a time \Nwith a cursed technique is far too inefficient.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:23.72,0:04:26.61,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,So the method of evolution \Nthat Kenjaku has chosen
Dialogue: 0,0:04:26.61,0:04:29.48,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,is to assimilate mankind with me.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:33.62,0:04:36.02,Default,Yuji,0,0,0,,Huh? But your assimilation...
Dialogue: 0,0:04:36.02,0:04:38.28,Default,Fushiguro,0,0,0,,...should only be possible with \Nthe Star Plasma Vessel.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:40.26,0:04:42.22,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,Previously, that was true.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:43.95,0:04:47.35,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,But since I started evolving\Ntwelve years ago,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:49.91,0:04:54.54,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,assimilation with someone other than \Nthe Star Plasma Vessel is possible.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:55.97,0:04:57.98,Default,Choso,0,0,0,,But you're just one person, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:58.44,0:05:01.48,Default,Choso,0,0,0,,How would you assimilate \Nwith multiple people?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:01.72,0:05:06.23,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,What you see before you right \Nnow isn't my real self.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:06.23,0:05:10.19,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,Now that I've evolved, \Nmy soul is everywhere.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:10.53,0:05:11.72,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,I told you, didn't I?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:11.72,0:05:14.07,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,The world itself is who I am now.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:14.07,0:05:18.25,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,People who assimilated with me now would \Nbecome something more than a sorcerer.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:18.25,0:05:22.46,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,They would become a new being \Nthat's both there and not there.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:22.46,0:05:25.18,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,I'm able to retain my shape and reason
Dialogue: 0,0:05:25.18,0:05:28.63,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,after evolving because of \Nmy barrier techniques.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:28.63,0:05:30.83,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,However, if mankind were to evolve,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:30.83,0:05:34.44,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,then if even one of them \Nwent out of control,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:35.35,0:05:36.56,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,the world would end.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:36.56,0:05:37.57,Default,Tsukumo,0,0,0,,Why?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:37.55,0:05:39.98,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,There would be no boundaries \Nbetween individuals,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:39.98,0:05:42.73,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,so evil would spread to all instantly.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:42.74,0:05:46.10,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,The impurities of a hundred million \Npeople would flood the world.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:46.10,0:05:50.21,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,What happened in Tokyo would be \Nrecreated on a worldwide scale.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:50.62,0:05:52.87,Default,Yuji,0,0,0,,Why would he do such a thing?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:53.37,0:05:54.45,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,I don't know.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:54.45,0:05:56.12,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,I told you that, too.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:56.12,0:05:59.71,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,I can't tell what's going \Non in people's hearts.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:00.65,0:06:05.54,Default,Maki,0,0,0,,But wouldn't everything be fine as long \Nas you rejected the assimilation?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:05.54,0:06:07.92,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,That's the issue.
Dialogue: 1,0:06:07.92,0:06:14.13,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,Now that I've evolved, my nature is closer to \Nthat of a Cursed Spirit than a human.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:14.58,0:06:16.09,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,So I can be
Dialogue: 0,0:06:16.91,0:06:19.86,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,targeted by Cursed Spirit Manipulation.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:21.40,0:06:25.09,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,Considering Kenjaku's \Nstrength as a sorcerer,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:25.09,0:06:28.55,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,I would likely be absorbed \Nthe moment he made contact.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:28.55,0:06:30.95,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,That's why my main body is rejecting
Dialogue: 0,0:06:30.95,0:06:33.92,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,everything in the\NTombs of the Star right now.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:34.12,0:06:36.02,Default,Okkotsu,0,0,0,,That's why you want us to guard you?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:36.53,0:06:37.57,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,Yes.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:37.57,0:06:40.91,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,Kenjaku is second only to me in \Nhis skill with barrier techniques.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:40.91,0:06:44.59,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,I don't know when he'll manage to break \Nthe seal on the Tombs of the Star.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:45.03,0:06:46.60,Default,Tsukumo,0,0,0,,Why now?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:46.60,0:06:49.07,Default,Tsukumo,0,0,0,,You were stopped from assimilating \Nwith the Star Plasma Vessel.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:49.07,0:06:50.86,Default,Tsukumo,0,0,0,,Now you've been forced to evolve,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:50.86,0:06:54.13,Default,Tsukumo,0,0,0,,and he seeks to absorb you with \NCursed Energy Manipulation.
Dialogue: 1,0:06:54.13,0:06:57.79,Default,Tsukumo,0,0,0,,Kenjaku also seems to have \Nconnections to Sukuna.
Dialogue: 1,0:06:57.79,0:07:00.85,Default,Tsukumo,0,0,0,,So he's been a sorcerer \Nfor at least 1,000 years.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:00.85,0:07:03.31,Default,Tsukumo,0,0,0,,So why now?!
Dialogue: 0,0:07:03.74,0:07:07.30,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,Because I, the Star Plasma \NVessel, and the Six Eyes
Dialogue: 0,0:07:07.95,0:07:11.38,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,are all connected by fate.
Dialogue: 1,0:07:12.40,0:07:16.41,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,Twice in the past, Kenjaku was stopped \Nby the sorcerer with the Six Eyes.
Dialogue: 1,0:07:16.41,0:07:18.90,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,The second time, Kenjaku was thorough.
Dialogue: 1,0:07:18.90,0:07:21.15,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,He killed both the Star \NPlasma Vessel and the bearer
Dialogue: 1,0:07:21.15,0:07:23.50,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,of the Six Eyes within \Na month of their birth.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:23.76,0:07:26.00,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,Despite that, the Six Eyes \Nand the Star Plasma Vessel
Dialogue: 0,0:07:26.00,0:07:28.33,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,still appeared by the \Nday of my assimilation.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:28.33,0:07:32.05,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,After that, Kenjaku altered his \Nstrategy to focus on sealing
Dialogue: 0,0:07:32.05,0:07:33.91,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,the Six Eyes instead of killing him,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:33.91,0:07:36.55,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,and he began searching\Nfor the Prison Realm,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:36.89,0:07:40.55,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,because there can't be two people \Nwith the Six Eyes at the same time.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:40.55,0:07:44.11,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,However, twelve years ago, \Nsomething unpredictable happened.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:44.11,0:07:46.64,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,Toji Zenin intervened.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:47.52,0:07:50.43,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,He was physically gifted \Nthrough a Heavenly Binding Vow.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:50.43,0:07:52.17,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,And he was unique among them
Dialogue: 0,0:07:52.17,0:07:55.24,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,for being completely \Nfree from cursed energy.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:57.52,0:08:00.99,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,Since his Heavenly Binding Vow \Nplaced him outside of fate,
Dialogue: 0,0:08:00.99,0:08:04.53,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,he destroyed the fate connecting us.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:05.32,0:08:09.49,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,Then a young man with power of \NCursed Spirit Manipulation appeared.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:09.98,0:08:11.05,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,Without even trying,
Dialogue: 0,0:08:11.05,0:08:14.34,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,he now had all the necessary pieces\Nother than the Prison Realm.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:14.34,0:08:16.29,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,Then, six years ago,
Dialogue: 0,0:08:16.29,0:08:20.51,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,the Prison Realm made its way \Ninto Kenjaku's hands, as well.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:20.76,0:08:24.47,Default,Fushiguro,0,0,0,,Then why is this\NCulling Game being hosted?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:24.93,0:08:27.66,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,It's a warm-up before assimilation.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:28.38,0:08:31.69,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,My assimilation with people other \Nthan the Star Plasma Vessel is possible,
Dialogue: 0,0:08:31.69,0:08:33.94,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,but at the moment, \Nthere's a high probability
Dialogue: 0,0:08:33.94,0:08:35.86,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,it will result in something incomplete.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:36.54,0:08:39.73,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,The Culling Game uses the \Ncursed energy of the Players
Dialogue: 0,0:08:39.73,0:08:42.78,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,and the boundaries formed \Nbetween the Colonies
Dialogue: 1,0:08:42.78,0:08:46.35,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,in a ritual to send this nation's \Npeople to the other side.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:46.35,0:08:49.13,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,He probably plans to use that as a warm-up
Dialogue: 0,0:08:49.13,0:08:50.87,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,to start their assimilation with me.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:52.17,0:08:55.43,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,However, in order to establish that ritual,
Dialogue: 0,0:08:55.43,0:08:58.42,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,Kenjaku should have been forced \Nto accept several pacts.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:02.10,0:09:07.61,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,One of them is that Kenjaku cannot be the \NGame Master of the Culling Game himself.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:07.61,0:09:10.65,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,However, that still serves as \Na disadvantage to you all,
Dialogue: 0,0:09:10.65,0:09:14.61,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,because it means that killing Kenjaku \Nwon't end the Culling Game.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:15.43,0:09:17.97,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,Either all of the Players must die,
Dialogue: 0,0:09:17.97,0:09:21.55,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,or the Players must all refuse \Nto participate and die.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:21.55,0:09:23.91,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,The Culling Game won't end until then.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:23.91,0:09:27.07,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,The "continuation" mentioned \Nin the Culling Game's rules
Dialogue: 0,0:09:27.07,0:09:30.80,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,is insurance to prevent the \Nritual from being stopped.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:30.80,0:09:32.20,Default,Fushiguro,0,0,0,,In that case...
Dialogue: 0,0:09:32.20,0:09:33.18,Default,Okkotsu,0,0,0,,Yeah.
