Salvation is the plan.} {CR: A net of compassion and a rope of salvation, huh?}
Dialogue: 0,0:02:14.78,0:02:16.95,Default,Tsukumo,0,0,0,,The name's a bit too on-the-nose. {Not a hint of irony in that name.} {He didn't even try for sarcasm with that name.}

Dialogue: 0,0:03:23.72,0:03:26.44,Default,Maki,0,0,0,,Are you afraid of being sealed or something?
Dialogue: 0,0:03:26.44,0:03:27.98,Default,Tsukumo,0,0,0,,That's a bit much.

Dialogue: 0,0:03:38.70,0:03:40.12,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,{\fade(200,0)}Very well.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:43.37,0:03:46.08,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,Let us speak of Kenjaku.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:46.87,0:03:53.21,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,That man's objective is to force \Nthe evolution of mankind across Japan.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:54.42,0:03:56.09,Default,Fushiguro,0,0,0,,We've heard that part.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:56.67,0:03:59.47,Default,Fushiguro,0,0,0,,But how does he actually intend to do it?
Dialogue: 0,0:03:59.47,0:04:03.93,Default,Fushiguro,0,0,0,,Back when Kenjaku hijacked your barriers,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:03.93,0:04:08.44,Default,Fushiguro,0,0,0,,why didn't he turn everyone into sorcerers \Nwith Idle Transfiguration?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:10.10,0:04:14.23,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,Because he simply lacked the cursed energy to do so.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:14.65,0:04:19.07,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,Cursed energy refined through Uzumaki \Ncannot return to the sorcerer.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:19.07,0:04:23.70,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,Evolving one person at a time \Nwith a cursed technique is far too inefficient.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:23.70,0:04:29.58,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,So the method of evolution Kenjaku has chosen \Nis to assimilate mankind with me.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:33.63,0:04:36.09,Default,Yuji,0,0,0,,Wait, but your assimilation...
Dialogue: 0,0:04:36.09,0:04:38.34,Default,Fushiguro,0,0,0,,...should only be possible with the Star Plasma Vessel.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:40.26,0:04:42.22,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,Previously, that was true.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:43.93,0:04:47.35,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,But since I started evolving\Ntwelve years ago,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:50.02,0:04:54.82,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,it is now possible for me to assimilate \Nwith someone other than the Star Plasma Vessel.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:55.98,0:04:57.99,Default,Choso,0,0,0,,But there's only one of you.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:58.57,0:05:01.49,Default,Choso,0,0,0,,How would you assimilate with multiple people?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:01.49,0:05:06.24,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,What you see before you right now isn't my real self.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:06.24,0:05:10.21,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,Now that I've evolved, my soul exists {\i1}everywhere{\i0}.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:10.21,0:05:14.13,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,Like I said, the world itself is who I am now.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:14.13,0:05:18.34,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,People who assimilate with me now \Nwould become something more than a sorcerer.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:18.34,0:05:22.55,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,A new form of existence \Nthat's both there and not there.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:22.55,0:05:28.64,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,I'm able to retain my form and reason after evolving \Nbecause of my barrier techniques.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:28.64,0:05:30.81,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,However, if mankind were to evolve,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:30.81,0:05:35.57,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,then even one of them \Ngoing out of control would spell
Dialogue: 0,0:05:35.57,0:05:36.57,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,the end of the world. {timing is so jank on this one}
Dialogue: 0,0:05:36.57,0:05:37.57,Default,Tsukumo,0,0,0,,Why?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:37.57,0:05:42.74,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,There would be no boundaries between individuals, \Nso evil would spread to all instantly.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:42.74,0:05:46.12,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,The impurities of a hundred million people would flood the world.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:46.12,0:05:50.20,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,What happened in Tokyo \Nwould spread to the entire world.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:50.75,0:05:52.87,Default,Yuji,0,0,0,,Why would he do such a thing?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:53.46,0:05:54.50,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,I don't know.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:54.50,0:05:59.80,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,Like I said, I can't tell what's in people's hearts.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:00.76,0:06:05.55,Default,Maki,0,0,0,,In that case, why not simply reject the assimilation?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:05.55,0:06:07.93,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,Therein lies the issue.
Dialogue: 1,0:06:07.93,0:06:14.15,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,Now that I've evolved, \Nmy nature is closer to a curse than a human.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:14.77,0:06:19.69,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,And that makes me a target for Curse Manipulation.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:19.69,0:06:19.82,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,{\clip(m 1524 922.67 l 1522.67 1062.67 226.67 1042.67 233.33 908)}And that makes me a target for Curse Manipulation.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:19.82,0:06:19.94,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,{\clip(m 1266.67 900 l 1260 1057.33 201.33 1044 194.67 893.33)}And that makes me a target for Curse Manipulation.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:19.94,0:06:20.03,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,{\clip(m 996 926.67 l 1004 1058.67 201.33 1056 220 906.67)}And that makes me a target for Curse Manipulation.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:20.03,0:06:20.15,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,{\clip(m 641.33 905.33 l 634.67 1062.67 181.33 1060 206.67 900)}And that makes me a target for Curse Manipulation.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:20.15,0:06:20.23,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,{\clip(m 322.67 917.33 l 326.67 1065.33 158.67 1060 161.33 912)}And that makes me a target for Curse Manipulation.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:21.40,0:06:28.24,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,Considering Kenjaku's strength as a sorcerer, \NI would likely be absorbed the moment we made contact.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:28.24,0:06:34.12,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,That's why my main body is rejecting everything \Nin the Tombs of the Star right now.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:34.12,0:06:36.54,Default,Okkotsu,0,0,0,,That's why you want us to guard you?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:36.54,0:06:37.54,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,Yes.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:37.54,0:06:40.96,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,Kenjaku is second only to me \Nin his skill with barrier techniques.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:40.96,0:06:44.59,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,He might breach this place at any moment.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:45.01,0:06:46.59,Default,Tsukumo,0,0,0,,Why now?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:46.59,0:06:49.18,Default,Tsukumo,0,0,0,,Your assimilation with the Star Plasma Vessel failed,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:49.18,0:06:50.89,Default,Tsukumo,0,0,0,,which forced you to evolve,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:50.89,0:06:54.14,Default,Tsukumo,0,0,0,,and now he seeks to absorb you with Curse Manipulation.
Dialogue: 1,0:06:54.64,0:06:57.77,Default,Tsukumo,0,0,0,,Kenjaku also seems to have connections to Sukuna.
Dialogue: 1,0:06:57.77,0:07:00.86,Default,Tsukumo,0,0,0,,That means he's been a sorcerer for at least 1,000 years.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:00.86,0:07:03.32,Default,Tsukumo,0,0,0,,So why {\i1}now{\i0}?!
Dialogue: 0,0:07:03.86,0:07:11.41,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,Because I, the Star Plasma Vessel, and the Six Eyes \Nare all connected by fate.
Dialogue: 1,0:07:12.50,0:07:16.46,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,Twice in the past, Kenjaku was stopped \Nby the sorcerer with the Six Eyes.
Dialogue: 1,0:07:16.46,0:07:18.96,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,The second time, Kenjaku was thorough.
Dialogue: 1,0:07:18.96,0:07:23.51,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,He killed both the Star Plasma Vessel and the \Nbearer of the Six Eyes within a month of their birth.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:23.51,0:07:28.34,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,Nonetheless, they both still appeared \Nby the day of my assimilation.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:28.34,0:07:33.97,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,After that, Kenjaku altered his strategy \Nto focus on sealing the Six Eyes instead of killing him,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:33.97,0:07:36.56,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,and began searching for the Prison Realm.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:36.56,0:07:40.56,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,This is because there can't be two people \Nwith the Six Eyes at the same time.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:40.56,0:07:44.15,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,However, twelve years ago, \Nsomething unpredictable happened.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:44.15,0:07:46.49,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,Zenin Toji intervened.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:47.70,0:07:50.62,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,He had immense physical prowess \Ndue to a Heavenly Restriction.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:50.62,0:07:55.25,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,And even among them, he was an anomaly \Nwho completely broke free from cursed energy.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:57.62,0:08:04.55,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,The man who escaped fate through the power of Restriction \Nshattered the fate that tied us.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:05.34,0:08:09.55,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,Then came along a young man \Nwith the power of Curse Manipulation.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:10.09,0:08:14.52,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,Without even trying, he had all the necessary pieces \Nexcept for the Prison Realm.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:14.52,0:08:20.52,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,Then, six years ago, \Neven that fell into Kenjaku's hands.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:20.86,0:08:24.94,Default,Fushiguro,0,0,0,,Then why is this Culling Game being hosted?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:24.94,0:08:27.32,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,It's a warm-up before assimilation.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:28.40,0:08:31.82,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,My assimilation with someone other than \Nthe Star Plasma Vessel is possible,
Dialogue: 0,0:08:31.82,0:08:36.45,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,but at the moment, there's a high probability it will result in something incomplete.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:36.45,0:08:42.46,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,The Culling Game uses the cursed energy of the Players\Nand the boundaries between the Colonies
Dialogue: 0,0:08:42.46,0:08:46.55,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,in a ritual to ferry the people of this nation \Nto the other side.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:46.55,0:08:50.97,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,He likely intends to use that as a warm-up to start their assimilation with me.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:52.39,0:08:58.27,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,However, sustaining a ritual of this scale \Nrequires Kenjaku to bear several Binding Vows.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:02.10,0:09:07.61,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,One of them is that Kenjaku himself \Ncannot be the Game Master of the Culling Game.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:07.61,0:09:10.65,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,However, that only serves as a \Ndisadvantage to you all.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:10.65,0:09:14.70,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,Because it means that killing Kenjaku \Nwon't end the Culling Game. {why did the camera cut to him? was he planning to unleash his potential on kenny?}
Dialogue: 0,0:09:15.58,0:09:21.67,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,{\bord4}Either all of the Players die,\Nor they refuse to participate and die.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:21.67,0:09:23.96,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,The Culling Game won't end until then.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:23.96,0:09:30.80,Default,Tengen,0,0,0,,The clause prohibiting any "long-lasting" additions \Nensures that nothing can interrupt the ritual.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:30.80,0:09:32.26,Default,Fushiguro,0,0,0,,In that case...
Dialogue: 0,0:09:32.26,0:09:33.18,Default,Okkotsu,0,0,0,,Yeah.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:35.68,0:09:38.22,Default,Okkotsu,0,0,0,,We'll have to participate in the Culling Game,
Dialogue: 0,0:09:38.22,0:09:44.10,Default,Okkotsu,0,0,0,,and add a rule that creates a way out \Nfor Tsumiki{**-san} and those reluctant to participate.
